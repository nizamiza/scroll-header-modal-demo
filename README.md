Hey-

Open the `index.html` in your browser to see the demo. You can also use a simple HTTP server to host it locally and open the localhost
address:

```sh
http-server
```

The HTML file has a `script` tag at the bottom with some JS that handles the scrolling logic. Relevant CSS starts at line `116`.
